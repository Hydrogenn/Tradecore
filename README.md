# Tradecore

As of right now, you can make accounts, and accounts can have things.
Accounts can neither make, trade, or use things.
So yes, you could say it's not quite finished.

This is running under both the name Matom (Make A Ton Of Money) and Tradecore, neither of which have a readily available web address for .net or .com

The database is specified in .gitignore, so you will have to create your own superuser and other information.

Also, this contains a polls app. Which is entirely useless, done as practice, and should be gutted.
